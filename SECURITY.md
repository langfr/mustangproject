## Reporting a Vulnerability

Feel free to submit issues to info at mustangproject.org with [security] indicated in the subject. 
We may ask back questions but we usually open (or communicate about) an issue (potentially in a private location you would be provided with access to) and decide on the severity within two working days. 

Please indicate 
* a proof of concept, if possible
* If any of the information you submit, e.g. an invoice which can not be [anonymized](https://github.com/ZUGFeRD/einvoice-anonymizer), is confidential
* A quick justification why you require a fix in a older version than he most up to date one, if you can not update to the most recent version
* If you require encrypted communication (our GPG fingerprint will likely be 68F4 2269 8165 F0F5 63CA  A13B 7CB7 1548 B596 66A3)


## After your Report

We try to fix critical issues in less than a week, and release a fixed version in less than two weeks.

Thank you for keeping our software safe!
